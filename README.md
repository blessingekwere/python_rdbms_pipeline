# python_rdbms_pipeline

## About the project
This project aims to create a Python pipeline that can interact with a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). It utilizes the Microsoft SQL Server database "AdventureWorks," a fictional company's sample database, to demonstrate and practice SQL queries, data modeling, and business intelligence scenarios.

## Brief Description
This project aims to create a Python pipeline that can interact with a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). It utilizes the Microsoft SQL Server database "AdventureWorks," a fictional company's sample database, to demonstrate and practice SQL queries, data modeling, and business intelligence scenarios.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to develop a Python pipeline capable of interacting with a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). Specifically, the pipeline will connect to the Microsoft SQL Server database "AdventureWorks," a widely used sample database for learning SQL and exploring business intelligence scenarios.

The AdventureWorks database represents a fictional company and includes tables for employees, products, sales, and other business-related entities. This project will leverage this database to practice executing SQL commands, uploading data, and extracting data using Python.

## Project Aim and Objectives
The main aim of this project is to create a robust pipeline that can seamlessly interact with an RDBMS, such as Microsoft SQL Server. By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience in the following areas:

1. **Connecting to a SQL database from Python**: Establish a connection between Python and the AdventureWorks database, enabling data manipulation and querying.

2. **Executing SQL commands**: Learn how to execute various SQL commands, including Data Definition Language (DDL) commands for creating and altering tables, and Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands for inserting, updating, and deleting data.

3. **Uploading data from external sources**: Develop the ability to read data from CSV files and upload it to the SQL Server database, handling file paths and exceptions.

4. **Extracting data from SQL Server**: Write complex SQL queries to retrieve specific data from the database, such as orders placed within a certain time frame, and store the results in a structured format using Python's Pandas library.

5. **Data manipulation and export**: Perform data manipulation tasks on the extracted data using Pandas, and export the processed data to a CSV file for further analysis or reporting.

By completing this project, I gained valuable skills in integrating Python with an RDBMS, enabling me to build robust data pipelines and leverage the power of SQL for data analysis and business intelligence tasks.

## Tools and Resources
To complete this project, I used the following tools:

- Microsoft SQL Server
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio
- Python
- Visual Studio Code (An Integrated Development Environment (IDE))
- AdventureWorksDW2019.bak database backup file

The project is divided into three main exercises, each focusing on a specific aspect of the pipeline. Each exercise has its own set of tasks and learning objectives. By completing these exercises, I gained a more practical experience in executing SQL commands, uploading data, and extracting data using Python.
